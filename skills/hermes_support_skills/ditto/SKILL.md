# Ditto

Use the `heyditto` CLI to save, search, fetch, and traverse the user's long-term memory graph at [heyditto.ai](https://heyditto.ai). Memories are conversation **pairs** (one User turn + one Ditto turn) identified by a `pair_id`. **Subjects** are graph nodes for topics, identified by `subject_id`.

> The package `@heyditto/cli` ships **two interchangeable binaries**: `heyditto` and `ditto`. This skill standardizes on **`heyditto`** in every example because on macOS Apple ships its own `/usr/bin/ditto` (a file-copy utility) that can shadow the npm CLI; `heyditto` has no such collision. If you're on a system where plain `ditto` resolves to the npm bin, the two names are identical.

## Safety Gate (Hermes Support)

Sebelum memakai skill ini, wajib konfirmasi eksplisit dari user untuk:
- akses memori eksternal Ditto
- menjalankan perintah yang menyimpan data (`heyditto save`)

Jangan pernah menyimpan data sensitif (password, token, OTP, PIN, cookie/session).
Jika user mengirim data sensitif, tolak penyimpanan dan minta user rotasi/replace kredensial.

## When to Use

Reach for Ditto memory whenever the user:

- Says "remember…", "save this", "note that…", "for later".
- Says "what did I…", "recall…", "have I told you about…", "from my notes".
- Asks a question best answered from their prior context, not general knowledge.
- References a topic, person, project, or thread that isn't in this conversation but might be in their memory.

## Prerequisites

The `heyditto` CLI ([`@heyditto/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heyditto/cli)) must be on PATH at version **1.1.3 or newer** (the version that introduced both the `heyditto` alias bin and `--output` support). Hermes installs Node.js as part of its install, so:

```bash
npm install -g @heyditto/cli@latest
heyditto --version    # should print 1.1.3 or newer
```

`DITTO_API_KEY` is prompted by Hermes at skill-install time (declared above). Hermes passes it through to all `terminal` and `execute_code` calls automatically — no manual `export` needed.

## Procedure

Always call the CLI with `--output json` so output is structured and easy to summarize back to the user.

```bash
heyditto status --output json    # confirm key + endpoint + tools resolve
```

### Recall — "what did I say about X"

Search for previews, then fetch full text for the top hit(s).

```bash
heyditto search "X" --output json
heyditto fetch <pairId from step 1> --output json
```

Summarize the fetched memory text for the user.

### Opinion / preference — "what do I think about X"

Hit the subject graph first, then drill into matching memories.

```bash
heyditto subjects "X" --top-k 5 --output json
heyditto memories <subjectId> --output json
heyditto fetch <pairId> --output json   # optional, for full text
```

### Save — "remember this" / spotted durable fact

```bash
heyditto save "<the durable fact, 1–3 sentences>" \
  --source hermes \
  --source-context "<optional: project, file, channel>" \
  --output json
```

Confirm to the user: "Saved."

### Graph traversal — "show me everything related to X"

```bash
heyditto search "X" --output json                              # find seed memory
heyditto network <pairId from step 1> --limit 30 --output json # related via shared subjects
```

## Tools (CLI surface)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `heyditto save <content> [--source <s>] [--source-context <c>]` | Persist a memory pair from an external source. |
| `heyditto search <query>...` | Semantic search across memories. Multiple positional args become an array of queries. |
| `heyditto fetch <pair-id>...` | Fetch full conversation text by pair id. |
| `heyditto subjects <query> [--top-k <n>]` | Search the subject graph (default 10, max 100). |
| `heyditto memories <subject-id>...` | Fetch memory previews scoped to specific subjects. |
| `heyditto network <pair-id> [--limit <n>]` | Traverse memories connected via shared subjects (default 20, max 50). |
| `heyditto status` | Endpoint + key source + live tool list. |
| `heyditto config` | Print Claude Desktop / Cursor / generic-MCP-client config snippet. |
| `heyditto help` | Full reference. |

`heyditto status` prints the live tool list straight from the MCP — trust it over this file if anything drifts. `ditto <subcommand>` works identically when the npm bin wins on PATH.

## Pitfalls

- **`heyditto: command not found`** → `@heyditto/cli` isn't installed or is older than 1.1.3 (which introduced the `heyditto` alias). Run `npm install -g @heyditto/cli@latest` and reopen the shell.
- **`Unknown option '--output'`** → installed `@heyditto/cli` is older than 1.1.3. Same fix: `npm install -g @heyditto/cli@latest`.
- **`ditto: unrecognized option '--output'` or `Usage: ditto [ <options> ] src [ ... src ] dst`** (only seen if a user typed `ditto` instead of `heyditto` on macOS) → that's Apple's `/usr/bin/ditto` shadowing the npm CLI. Stick to `heyditto` (no collision) or run `type -a ditto` and reorder PATH.
- **`error: no Ditto API key configured`** → `DITTO_API_KEY` didn't make it into the shell. Re-prompt the user via `hermes skills config ditto`, or fall back to `heyditto login <key>` to write `~/.config/heyditto/cli/config.json` directly.
- **Connection failures** → run `heyditto status --output json`; rotate via `heyditto logout && heyditto login <new-key>`.
- **Empty results** → user may not have memories matching the query. Suggest they save the fact with `heyditto save` if it's worth keeping.
- **Schema drift** → run `heyditto status --output json` and `heyditto help` for the current surface.

## Verification

```bash
heyditto status --output json | jq '.tools'                  # array of MCP tool names
heyditto subjects "test" --output json | jq '.results | length'
```

Both should succeed with a valid key.
